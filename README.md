The basic idea is to replace identifying codes used for bussiness and individuals. Eliminating the need for social security numbers and f.e.i.n.'s..  One day every bussiness and idividual will be given or create an individualized token to represent you or your bussiness. In order to use or gain more of your token (which will have a set satoshi value for every token) a consumer, person or bussiness will simply utilize their personalized token and create/swap into the other parties persoanilized token leaving the original token to be burned. The future is only begining to see the of the impact blockchain and smart contract technology will have shapeing our world. Your persoanlized token can only be stored in your personalized wallet and will have to be swapped or create another token to be moved. With these personlized tokens evrything from purchases to voting will utilize your token creating a more honest and personally accountable business and individual. This seems to be the only way to create a more organized world of information moving forward. Keeping personal information safe and lend its self to help revolutionize a one world compatible system equal for all people and intities. White paper coming soon.
